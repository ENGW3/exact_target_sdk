= ExactTarget SDK

An object-oriented wrapper for the ExactTarget SOAP API.

The ExactTarget web service guide can be viewed here:
http://docs.code.exacttarget.com/020_Web_Service_Guide

With few exceptions, ruby conventions for capitalization are ignored and those
outlined in the guide linked above are used. This is done in an attempt to be
as transparent as possible, so that the API may be used by referring only to
the guide linked above.

Note this SDK is currently quite incomplete, supporting only a subset of the
possible objects and methods. The framework is in place, however, to very
easily implement new objects by simply declaring their properties.

== Synopsis:

 ExactTargetSDK.config(:username => 'foo', :password => 'mypass')

 client = ExactTargetSDK::Client.new
 definition = ExactTargetSDK::TriggeredSendDefinition.new('CustomerKey' => 'my_triggered_send')
 subscriber = ExactTargetSDK::Subscriber.new('EmailAddress' => 'me@example.com')
 triggered_send = ExactTargetSDK::TriggeredSend.new('TriggeredSendDefinition' => definition)
 triggered_send.Subscribers << subscriber

 # Creates subscriber record, then executes the "my_triggered_send" trigger to
 # that subscriber.
 response = client.Create(subscriber, triggered_send)

 puts "response status: #{response.OverallStatus}"
 response.Results.each do |result|
   puts "result..."
   puts "  result code: #{result.StatusCode}"
   puts "  result message: #{result.StatusMessage}"
 end

== Perform (execute) an ImportDefinition:

 ExactTargetSDK.config(:username => 'foo', :password => 'mypass')
 client = ExactTargetSDK::Client.new
 id = ExactTargetSDK::ImportDefinition.new("CustomerKey" => "APITest1")
 response = client.Perform("Start", id)
 response.Results.each do |result|
   puts "  result code: #{result.result[:status_code]}"
   puts "  result code: #{result.result[:status_message]}"
 end
